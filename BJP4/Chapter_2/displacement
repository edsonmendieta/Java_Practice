In physics, a common useful equation for finding the position s of a body in linear motion at a given time t, based on its initial position s0, initial velocity v0, and rate of acceleration a, is the following:

s = s0 + v0 t + Â½ at2

Write code to declare variables for s0 with a value of 12.0, v0 with a value of 3.5, a with a value of 9.8, and t with a value of 10, and then write the code to compute s on the basis of these values. At the end of your code, print the value of your variable s to the console.


Solution:

double s = 0;

double initialPosition = 12.0;
double initialVelocity = 3.5;
double acceleration = 9.8;
int time = 10;


s = initialPosition + initialVelocity * time + (0.5 * (acceleration * (time * time)));

System.out.print(s);
