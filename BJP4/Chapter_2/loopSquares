Instructions:

Write a for loop that produces the following output:

1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 100 
For added challenge, try to modify your code so that it does not need to use the * multiplication operator. (It can be done! Hint: Look at the differences between adjacent numbers.)



Solution:

int differenceCounter = 0;

for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
    System.out.print(i + " ");
    differenceCounter += 2;
    i += differenceCounter;
}
